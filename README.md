# Web3-Recruitment-Task-Submission
The task code was very interesting but it was a but ambiguous. Hence I made some assumptions and made the code. Here’s how my code works!  I made a car class and defined the requisite attributes. But I made the speed attribute another class with its 3 co-ordinate components.  Now I took user input the co-ordinates and the speed with it’s 3 co-ordinates for the two cars separately. 
 Then I asked the user what car’s acceleration/braking do they want to modify, and accordingly invoked the acceleration/braking function.  the acceleration/braking function updates all the three co-ordinates of the speed function. Now I calculated the time taken for them to collide, and then invoked the move function. the move function updates all the three co-ordinates of the car, and the time is calculated by distance/absolute value of relative speed.
